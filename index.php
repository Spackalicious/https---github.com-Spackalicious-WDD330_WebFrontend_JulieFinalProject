            <p><br><i>*Currently, this site app is in the beta stages. Information you submit is ONLY kept on your end in localStorage. Clearing your cookies will clear your data. I do not yet have any databases set up to store your information. This includes login information. Eventually, I'll get this more polished. For now, un/pw will protect your info from your kids, which may or may not be helpful. *smile* If the data is important to you, a quick screenshot saved can keep your lists and notes from being lost on accident! Thank you for your understanding and patience!</i></p>
